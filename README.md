# Disable Mail

Silence WordPress email. Useful for non-production environments.

No dependencies; ultra-light mu-plugin. 

## Install

Dependency available on packagist: `composer require tiny-pixel/disallow-mail`.

Once installed, disable mail by defining `DISABLE_MAIL` as `TRUE` in wp-config.php. That's it.
